# Next Session Plan

## UI Refactor (ChatGPT Style)
- [x] **Color Scheme**: Update application colors to match ChatGPT's neutral grays and blacks.
- [x] **Chatbox Design**: Redesign the input area to be centered, floating, and visually similar to ChatGPT.
- [x] **Message Styling**: Remove colored bubbles in favor of the clean, icon-next-to-text layout used by ChatGPT.

## Functional Enhancements
- [ ] **Multiple File Upload**: Update the backend `UploadController` and frontend `ChatInterface` to support selecting and processing multiple files simultaneously.
- [x] **Collapsible Sidebar**: Improve the sidebar to be fully collapsible with a smooth transition, persisting the state.
